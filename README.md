# Laptop Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting laptop prices based on various features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and other specifications. Using machine learning models, the goal is to develop a system that can predict the price of a laptop based on its configuration.

## Motivation

The growing variety of laptops in the market, with different specifications and configurations, makes it difficult for customers to compare prices and make decisions. This project aims to simplify this process by providing price predictions based on specific features. It could also help sellers price their products competitively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various laptop configurations, including:
- Brand
- Processor type
- RAM (GB)
- Storage (GB)
- GPU
- Display size
- Operating System
- Price (target variable)

## Project Workflow

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Collection:** The dataset was collected from [dataset source or mention if it was web-scraped].
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, label encoding, scaling numeric features, and feature engineering.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding the distribution of data and relationships between features.
4. **Modeling:** Training and tuning various regression models.
5. **Evaluation:** Using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) to evaluate the models.
6. **Prediction:** Applying the best model to make predictions on new data.

## Modeling

The following models were implemented and evaluated:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **Ensemble Models:** Bagging, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting

Grid search was used to tune the hyperparameters of each model for optimal performance.

## Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-squared (R²)**

**Best Model:** After tuning and cross-validation, [best model name] performed the best with the following results:
- **MSE:** `Random Forest`
- **MAE:** `Voting`
- **R²:** `Random Forest`

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
  - XGBoost
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook/VS Code

## Results

The final model predicts laptop prices with an accuracy of `84%`. The most important features affecting the price were:
1. **Processor Type**
2. **RAM**
3. **Storage Type**
4. **Brand**

You can find the detailed analysis in the accompanying Jupyter notebooks.

## Future Work

There are a few areas where this project can be extended:
1. **Improve Feature Engineering:** Add more detailed features like battery life, weight, and build quality.
2. **Use of Deep Learning:** Test deep learning models for more complex patterns in the data.
3. **Deployment:** Deploy the model via a web application (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit) to allow users to input laptop specs and receive a price prediction.
4. **Expand the Dataset:** Include more laptops from different regions and brands to enhance generalization.
